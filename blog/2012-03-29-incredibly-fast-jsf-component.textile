Why is a&nbsp;JSF&nbsp;components&nbsp;development so&nbsp;painful?

It would be really great if I could **develop full-blown JSF components**&nbsp;wrapping some JavaScript UI widget as fast as I'm developing plain HTML,&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;it?

Just two words: **fast turnaround**!

Every tool and every framework which tries to simplify a process should have a strategy to allow a fast turnaround. It is lowering a&nbsp;**learning curve**&nbsp;and saves developers **many invaluable hours**. And mainly it makes working with the a tool a&nbsp;**pleasure**!

h2. RichFaces CDK

<div>
</div>The CDK project is sample of such a powerful tool - it allows you to write just two pieces -
<ul style="text-align: left;"><li>a Java component **interface**,</li><li>a HTML **renderer** (with Facelets-like syntax),</li></ul><div>and then it takes these definitions and</div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>**generates all the&nbsp;boilerplate**&nbsp;**code** automatically&nbsp;including</li><ul><li>all the Java code,</li><li>configurations (faces-config.xml and *.taglib.xml),</li><li>and a VDL documentation.</li></ul></ul><div>Brian Leathem has written **series of articles** introducing <a href="http://blog.bleathem.ca/search/label/CDK">how easy can JSF component development be when using RichFaces CDK</a>.</div><div>
</div><div>But besides it is the powerful tool,&nbsp;you can also achieve a&nbsp;**really fast development** turnaround using CDK- just by using proper tools!</div><div>

h2. <a href="https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces-sandbox/tree/master/hot-deployment">Quick Turnaround with RichFaces CDK</a>

There is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces-sandbox/tree/master/hot-deployment"><span style="font-size: large;">guide</span></a>&nbsp;which covers how to setup **your tooling** to start with a development.

It covers setting&nbsp;up&nbsp;the component and demo project in JBoss Tools (on top of Eclipse IDE) and how to&nbsp;**automatically trigger build** when you change CDK resources.

And to make the deployment phase as quick as possible?

We are using JRebel to **hot-deploy built resources** into JBoss AS 7, which is itself f&@#ng fast.


That's it!
