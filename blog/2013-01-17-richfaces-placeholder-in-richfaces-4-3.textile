In RichFaces 4.3 we build upon a great work from "Bernard Labno":https://plus.google.com/112932410824491900575/posts who prototyped the @<rich:placeholder />@ component and shared it in the "RichFaces Sandbox":https://github.com/richfaces/sandbox.

This component gives you an ability similar to the HTML5's placeholder - it pre-fills form inputs with text, which serves as a hint for users of what data is a particular input expects. Once you edit the input, the placeholder text will disappear.

You can try it out on the HTML 5 sample bellow:

<input type="text" placeholder="Placeholder text" />

h5. So why do you need this new component?

The HTML 5 placeholder attribute doesn't work in older browsers, so to ensure backward compatibility, you would need to use a JavaScript plugin like the one we have used: @$.watermark@.

With RichFaces, you can leverage that as simply as:

bc(prettify).. <h:inputText value="...">
    <rich:placeholder value="Type text here..." />
</h:inputText>

h5. Example

<a href="http://showcase.richfaces.org/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=placeholder&skin=blueSky"><img src="../../../images/blog/2013-01-17-richfaces-placeholder-in-richfaces-4-3/placeholder.png" /></a>

h3. Additional features

h4. Placeholder styling

You can style the placeholder text by using the CSS

bc(prettify).. .rf-plhdr {
   color: #eee
}

p. or for each component specifically with @styleClass@:

bc(prettify).. <rich:placeholder styleClass="my-special-placeholder" />

h4. Apply placeholder to multiple components

In order to apply placeholder to multiple components, you need to use @@selector@ attribute:

bc(prettify).. <h:inputText styleClass ="my-placeholder" />
<h:inputText styleClass ="my-placeholder" />
<rich:placeholder selector=".my-placeholder" text="Fill in..." />

h4. Support for a wide-range of components

We also make sure that @<rich:placeholder />@ works with all RichFaces input components, so you don't need to cope with incompatibilities.


h4. Give it a try

You can try this component in a "RichFaces Showcase sample":http://showcase.richfaces.org/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=placeholder&skin=blueSky.

You can also read more about it in the RichFaces "Component Reference":http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/4.3.X/4.3.0.CR1/Component_Reference/en-US/html/chap-Component_Reference-Functionality_extension.html#sect-Component_Reference-Functionality_extension-richplaceholder and "VDL documentation":http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/4.3.X/4.3.0.CR1/vdldoc/rich/placeholder.html.
